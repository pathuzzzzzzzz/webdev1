    <h2>Re: Felix  university application</h2>

    <p>Dear Felix,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join the University of California's faculty to study as a post-doctoral researcher. I will review your application in detail in the following weeks.</p>

    <h3>Starting Date</h3>

    <p>We can start accommodating a starting date that suits you. Please let me know if it would be better for you to start at the beginning of winter quarter, or in the spring, with the following options:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First semester: 29 September 2024</li>
        <li>Second semester : 6 February 2025
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2025</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please let me know which, if any, of these dates you would prefer.</p>

    <h3>Subjects of Study</h3>

    <p>As you are aware, I have a lot of activity in open source research projects. As long as the subjects fall within the scope of the Human-Computer Interaction group at UCSC, we can accommodate a wide range of interests. Here are some of the areas of research that you might be interested in:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>*HCI in the context of privacy and security:* You have mentioned your intelligent, whimsical, and just plain weird side. I'm also interested in the ethics of using technology for surveillance. We could explore this area together.</li>
        <li>*HTML5 and CSS3:* We can explore performance on touch-enabled devices, including long-term testing when the battery is drained to 10% or less.</li>
        <li>*Web-based games:* We can explore how to make games that are both fun and educational.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please feel free to provide more information on any of these topics, or to suggest your own. Your questions and ideas are always welcome.</p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes, you are quite right. My favorite dance moves are the robot, the chicken dance, and the YMCA. I know all the words to the YMCA song, and I can do the dance perfectly.</p>
<h2>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <h3>Polynesian Chicken Dance</h3>
    <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be fruitful.</p>

    <h3>Icelandic Brown Shuffle</h3>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved rapid movements together in a circle on the floor, shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very stylish close moves. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>

    <h3>Arctic Robot</h3>
    <p>As an interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by robotic, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>

    <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p>


    <p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
